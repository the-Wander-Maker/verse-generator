Starting point: on Vogon poetry from one of literature's now classic science fiction novels,
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
If you want to delve into it, go ahead, but for now, that's all you need to know,
is that it's terrible. We'll be producing equally horrific poems with our next programme.
The lines of the poems always consist of an adjective, an object, an assertion,
and a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence ("We throw squeaky windows!?", "We eat spherical fountain coffee?!?")
a. Write a function called verse() without parameters,
that returns a line of verses, with the four parts of the sentence randomly chosen from four lists.
b. This function is called by another function called verse(). The parameter of verse() is a number,
which specifies the number of lines in the stanza. This function returns the entire stanza.
c. Our last function is called : verse(). Its first parameter is a number giving the number of verses,
the second is the number of lines per verse, returning the total verse.
d. Our poems show overflowing emotion, at least as indicated by the punctuation.
How can we very simply make the end of sentences end more often with a full stop ?

Jarvis Version 1.0

1. Expanding the existing vocabulary.

2. Deciding on the vocabulary storage
	- SQL
	- online <-> offline
		- own server?
		- Raspberry
		
3. Creating and implementing new sentence structures.

4. Higher level of interaction with the user.	// research, human behaviour patterns, frequently used reactions, phrases, etc.
	a, developing basic communication
		- greetings
		- that you are
		- interest
	b, developing higher level communication
		- reaction patterns
		- logical calculations for input <-> output relations
			- e.g. filtering what emotionally charged words the user uses
			
5. Going beyond the console interface, implementing a graphical interface

6. Creating an application from existing material.
